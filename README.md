# IDE
I am Using Tkinter Library in Python to create a new IDE . I love to try different IDE's and that was caused me to start building my own IDE.
I am a beginner in Tkinter and learning all the different possibilities of this library. 
Will add more features later in the IDE. 

Goals -
Add Syntax Highlighting
Add Dark interface
Add mark and make shortcut's available 


main goal is to have a fully customizable IDE by the end.
